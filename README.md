# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project
This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each 
assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, 
an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who 
have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment
Assignment 01: Classes, Encapsulation, and Unit Test Planning

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation in the `Client` and `BankAccount` classes was achieved by using private attributes (`__client_number`, `__balance`, etc.) and exposing only necessary properties using getter methods.
